- Use dot (.) seperation to access the array elements. Be careful to avoid dots in your keynames, it won't work
- Embed your Dwoo template code into the HTML structure. Indent like the surrounding code
- Tip: Dwoo template code is easier to find if you leave some blank lines before and/or after a command (e.g. loops)
