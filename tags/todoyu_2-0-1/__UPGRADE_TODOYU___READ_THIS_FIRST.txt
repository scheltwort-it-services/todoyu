INSTRUCTIONS TO UPGRADE AN EXISTING todoyu VERSION
==================================================

	1. Make a backup of your local config files in /config/ (db.php, extensions.php, etc)
	2. Extract the todoyu-rc2 archive into your todoyu folder (override all existing files)
	3. Copy back your backuped config files to replace the existing ones
	4. Run the installer /install/
	5. After update, clear your browser cache to see all the new stuff


Attention:
	We extended the installer to include basic data and optional demo data.
	The basic data contains predefined user roles with the respective rights presets.
	The optional demo data contains data like a project with some tasks and other
	records	to demonstrate the various aspects of todoyu.
	To install the basic and demo data you have to perform a fresh install of todoyu.
