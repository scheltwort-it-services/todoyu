Files in the lib/ folder should NOT be modified!
They may be replaced by an update of a library.
But sometimes it's necessary:

The following changes have been made:

# lib/js/scriptaculous/scriptaculous.js : 64
Commented out 'Scriptaculous.load();' All needed libraries are already loaded in the merge file

# lib/php/dwoo/plugins/builtin/functions/truncate.php
Replaced substr() and strlen() with multibyte versions.
Added utf-8 as encoding. Supports now truncating of asian (japanese) characters.

# lib/js/dhtmlxgantt/sources/dhtmlgantt.js : 1202
Commented out check of EST against parent task EST, to allow for display of "invalid" parent-child lineage

# lib/js/dhtmlxgantt/sources/dhtmlgantt.js : 3588
Commented out setting of calculated left position during checkPos-method, to allow for unrounded task starting times also during drag activities

# lib/js/dhtmlxgantt/sources/dhtmlgantt.js : 4006
Commented out check of miniumum movement ranges, to allow for dragging of tasks with "invalid" parent-child lineage
