Files in the lib/ folder should NOT be modified!
They may be replaced by an update of a library.
But sometimes it's necessary:

The following changes have been made:

# lib/php/dwoo/plugins/builtin/functions/truncate.php
Replaced substr() and strlen() with multibyte versions.
Added utf-8 as encoding. Supports now truncating of asian (japanese) characters.


# lib/js/tiny_mce/tiny_mce_src.js
Bugfix for version 3.5b3. See patch tinymce_destroy_hide_t.patch for details
Can be removed in version 3.5b4
