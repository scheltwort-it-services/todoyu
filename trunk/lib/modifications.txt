Files in the lib/ folder should NOT be modificated!
They may be replaced by an update of a library.
But sometimes it's necessary:

The following changes have been made:

# lib/js/scriptaculous/scriptaculous.js : 64
Commented out 'Scriptaculous.load();' All needed libraries are already loaded in the merge file

# lib/php/dwoo/plugins/builtin/functions/extends.php : 109
Replace replaceBlock() function with patched one
